# Quantel PAD USB interface
Interfaces a Quantel Paintbox input device (tablet, keyboard, rat/grip) and turns it into three USB
devices.

Requires a Raspberry Pi Pico 2040 and a Waveshare Pico-2CH-RS485 interface board.

Set `PICO_SDK_PATH` in your environment vars to wherever your `pico-sdk` is located. For convenience
I have added it as a submodule for this repo. So if your build directory is `build` then set
`PICO_SDK_PATH=../pico-sdk` That is, it's relative to the build directory not the source root.

## Quantel PAD input device packet format

### General description
- A packet is formed of 9 bytes.
- They are sent roughly every 10ms, implying a baud-rate of 9600.
- Packets are sent regardless of any input, so have to pay attention to key/pen/button flags.
- The MSb of byte 1 is always 1 to signify the start of a packet. All other bytes have the MSb cleared.
- Byte 9 is the XOR of each of the other bytes, masked to the least significant 7 bits.
- Pen position can be negative and uses 2's compliment, and seems to range from about -948, -528 in the top left, to 6759, 5324 in the bottom right.
- Key events are only sent on key transition, so key repeats have to be handled in software.
- It's probable that key data and pen data aren't transmitted in the same packet because of the use of byte 3, bit 6 for pen pressure. If so, this would probably be unnoticeable on original hardware because the screen refresh would only be 30 FPS.

### Keycodes
The keyboard used by the Quantel Express (and others?) is the [AKE079339/3 keyboard](https://imgur.com/gallery/quantel-paintboxs-mechanical-keyboard-teardown-lfhp8) 
How rollover is handled is as yet unknown, but expect odd things if more than one key is held down.

### Things left to figure out
- The exact range of the tablet.
- Does the range change based on the size of the tablet?
- Is pen data included in a keyboard event?
- Byte 2 bit 5 is always set, but all other unknowns are always unset.
